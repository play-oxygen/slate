Bearer authorization is a type of authentication used for accessing API endpoints securely. In this mechanism,
a client requesting access to the API must include an access token in the "Authorization" header of the HTTP
request. The access token is a unique and time-limited string of characters generated by an authentication server
upon successful login or token request.

The term "Bearer" indicates that the token serves as a bearer credential, granting access to the specified
resources without the need for additional authentication data. Once the API server receives the request, it
verifies the validity of the access token before allowing the client to access the protected resources. This
method ensures a higher level of security as it prevents unauthorized access and helps protect sensitive user data.
